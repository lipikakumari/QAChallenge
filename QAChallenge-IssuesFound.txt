Issue Discovered:

Api (lightbulb page):

Double click sends request twice instead of alternating the switch.





Web (PhpTravels site):



1.
Go to hotels tab

enter “sydney”(or any place not listed for hotels) in location .

search : no results are found

now click on Hotels tab again

it clears the search filters and loads the hotels list.


Expected : it should clear the search fields as well

Actual: It doesn’t clear the search field , causing confusion for user



2.
Website responsiveness is broken for search page.

example : 

Elements misalign on changing the form factor

Language support becomes inconsistent 



3.
Use safari to open the site

Search for hotels in Singapore  


expected : Hotels listed

Result :  javascript error :syntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'values'



4 .

Click on view map on Hotels page

Throws error : Uncaught ReferenceError: google is not defined



5.

check on any star grade in filters.

there is no way to uncheck this , user needs to reload the page to clear this flyer

also its  a radio button , instead of checkbox
